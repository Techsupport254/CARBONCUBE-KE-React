  "description": "grinding wheels, which are abrasive tools used for sharpening, cutting, smoothing, and shaping various materials. \r\nFunction:\r\nGrinding wheels are used in manufacturing, construction, and workshops for tasks like sharpening tools (knives, drill bits), cutting materials (metal, concrete), smoothing surfaces, and shaping workpieces. \r\nTypes of Abrasives:\r\nCommon abrasive materials include Ceramic Aluminium Oxide (known for self-sharpening and cooler cutting), Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) for high-speed steels, and Zirconia Alumina for metal workpieces. \r\nSafety:\r\nProper selection and use of grinding wheels are crucial due to potential hazards like flying debris, drawing-in injuries from loose clothing, and respiratory issues from dust/fumes. \r\nSelection:\r\nChoosing the correct grinding wheel depends on the material being worked on and the desired outcome (e.g., sharpening, cutting, finishing).",
